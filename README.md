# Hardhat-Trading-Bot

Welcome to the `Hardhat-Trading-Bot` repository, where we aim to demystify basic arbitrage strategies and empower aspiring blockchain developers to experience the world of arbitrage. We provide comprehensive code documentation and step-by-step instructions to make learning accessible, allowing developers to grasp the concepts and eventually craft their own effective strategies.

## What is Arbitrage?

Arbitrage is a trading strategy that capitalizes on price differences for the same asset across different markets. It involves buying low on one market and selling high on another to turn a profit.

## Why Blockchain Arbitrage?

Blockchain arbitrage presents developers with an opportunity to benefit financially, enhance their skill set, and promote market efficiency. It enables the exploitation of price differences, fosters a deeper understanding of blockchain technology, and contributes to fair market practices. When integrated into diversified trading strategies, it facilitates risk management and automation, occasionally enhancing market liquidity.

## Verification and Security

Every modification to this project undergoes a rigorous verification process, accompanied by digital signing. This stringent approach guarantees the authenticity and integrity of our codebase. If you encounter any modifications lacking adequate verification, we strongly discourage their use, as they may contain malicious code.

## Commented Code

Our codebase is meticulously documented with comprehensive comments, providing clarity on the functionality of individual components.

## Getting Started

To explore and engage with the `ArbitrageBot` project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CyberAnon1010101/Blockchain-ArbitrageBot.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have `node.js` and `npm` installed in your environment.

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Create and Setup .env File

Before deploying the `Arbitrage.sol` contract, create a **.env** file with the following components:

  ```env
  ARB_FOR=""             // Insert the Token0 address between the quotation marks
  ARB_AGAINST=""         // Insert the Token1 address between the quotation marks 
  PRICE_DIFFERENCE=""    // Replace the quotation marks with the price difference between the 2 DEXs 
  UNITS=""               // Replace the quotation marks with the price reported
  GAS_LIMIT=""           // Replace the quotation marks with the desired maximum gas limit
  GAS_PRICE=""           // Replace the quotation marks with the desired gwei price
  ```
For an example of what the **.env** file should look like, please see our [Hardhat Trading Bot Project Documentations](./Hardhat-Trading-Bot-Project-Documentations/.env.example).
